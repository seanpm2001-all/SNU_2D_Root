<H1>SNU Terms Of Service</H1>
<H2>Version 2.1</H2>
<H1>Hate speech</H1>
<H2>=============</H2>
<H2>The original censorship document was merged here, as it would fit better. You can view the original 
<a href="!SNUTOS_CENSORSHIP.html">Here</a>
<b>Warning, it's out of date! (as of February 17th 2019)</b>
<H2>SNU has a no-hate speech policy. Hate speech should NOT be promoted here. We have set in some guidelines on what you shouldn't say</H2>

<b>Germany,</b>
<b>Poland,</b>
<b>Austria</b>
<H2>Reason:</H2>
<p>World War II was a terrible tragedy with millions of lives lost. These countries were affected most by Nazi Germany. Austria also was the birth place of Hitler. These areas suffered massive casualties to the Hitler Regime, and it is hard to look back at what happened, especially when it happened in your own country</p>
<H2>Work-arounds</H2>
<p>You can use different symbols to get around this. However, you cannot use it as a way to promote hate, or promote anything that Nazi Hitler did</p>
<H1>Hammer and Sickle (☭)</H1>
<p>Banned in:</p>
<b>Germany</b>
<b>Japan</b>
<H2>Reason:</H2>
<p>This was the main symbol of the Soviet Union in Russia, and it caused millions of deaths in World War II<p>
<H2>Work-arounds</H2>
<p>If you aren't in Germany or Japan, you can use this symbol in a comedic way, but you cannot use it as a hate symbol</p>
<H2>The N word</H2>
<p>This word has a racist symbol. It can be used in educational situations, but it cannot be used as a hate word. Here are some examples of how NOT to use it:</p>
<H1>Keemstar uses the N word as a threat</H1>
