<H1>SNU Terms Of Service</H1>
<H2>Version 2.1</H2>
<H1>Account management</H1>
<H2>You are allowed to have multiple accounts on SNU, however there is a set guideline on how to manage them.</H2>
<H1>Account limits</H1>
<H2>You can't make too many accounts to subscribe or follow yourself, give yourself more views and likes, and have empty accounts for commenting. Please manage your accounts wisely. There is a set limit on how many accounts that can be made from a home IP tree</H2>
<H1>Banning/suspension</H1>
<H2>When an account is suspended, videos that caused a threat will be taken into the evidence locker, but most safe content will stay. It will however be locked. If you try and use another account to get away from your ban and start using it to get around the rules, you will receive an IP ban</H2>
