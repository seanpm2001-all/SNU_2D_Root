<H1>SNU Terms Of Service</H1>
<H2>Version 2.1</H2>
<H1>Educational content</H1>
<H2>You can make educational content for SNU as long as it is backed up my facts and evidence.</H2>
<H2>In historical videos, you can use symbols such as the swastica, hammer and sickle, confederate flag, KKK symbol, etc. However, you cannot promote hate in any way. History is designed to be taught so that we don't repeat our mistakes.</H2>
<H2>Your videos might get censored in Germany for using the swastica, so be careful.</H2>
<H2>Educational content CANNOT contain graphical war footage without a NSFW label. Even then, you can't go as far as traumatizing everyone. War is a very bad thing, and we must not repeat our mistakes</H2>
