<!-- <p>1D mode has a set of rules for development. These are in place to keep the simple style of the pages. The rules are pretty general.</p>
<H2>Allowed HTML tags</H2> !-->
<H1>NO GUIDELINES HAVE BEEN SET FOR 2D MODE YET</H1>
<!-- 
<p>The allowed HTML tags in 2D mode are:</p>

<p>No other tags are allowed here. This is to keep the page as simple as possible, and also to let it run in any web browser. If you want to use different tags, try 2D or 3D mode</p>
<HR>
<H2>Allowed Media types</H2>
<p>Even though this mode is text only, you can still reference some files. Just remember that images, videos, or audio files are not allowed</p>
<p>The allowed media types in 1D mode are:</p>
<p>.htm</p>
<p>.html</p>
<p>.txt</p>
<p>.exe</p>
<p>.iso</p>
<p>.rpm</p>
<p>.dmg</p>
<p>.img</p>
<p>.zip</p>
<p>.doc</p>
<p>.rtf</p>
<p>.bat</p>
<p>.bin</p>
<p>.odt</p>
<p>.tar</p>
<p>.7z</p>
<p>.tmp</p>
<p>No other file types can be references here. This mode is designed to be run on any browser, all the way down to Windows 3.1/System 7 (MacOS)/LINUX (unknown)/UNIX 7/etc</p>
<p>Again, if you want to use different media types, try 2D or 3D mode</p>
<HR>
<H2>Allowed colors</H2>
<p>1D mode has very partial color support, with only 16 supported colors.</p>
<p>Here are the allowed colors:</p>
<p>Black (RGB: 0,0,0 HEX: 000000)</p>
<p>Dark red (RGB: 128,0,0 HEX: Unknown</p>
<p>Red (RGB: 255,0,0 HEX: FF0000)</p>
<p>Pink (RGB: 255,0,255 HEX: FFC0CB)</p>
<p>Teal (RGB: 0,128,128 HEX: Unknown</p>
<p>Green (RGB: 0,128,0 HEX: Unknown</p>
<p>Bright green (RGB: 0,255,0 HEX: Unknown</p>
<p>Turquoise (RGB: 0,255,255 HEX: 40E0D0</p>
<p>Dark blue (RGB: 0,0,128 HEX: Unknown</p>
<p>Violet (RGB 128,0,128 HEX: Unknown</p>
<p>Blue (RGB: 0,0,255 HEX: 0000FFF)</p>
<p>Gray 25% (RGB: 192,192,0 HEX: Unknown</p>
<p>Gray 50% (RGB: 128,128,128 HEX: Unknown</p>
<p>Dark yellow (RGB: 128,128,0 HEX: Unknown</p>
<p>Yellow (RGB: 255,255,0 HEX: Unknown</p>
<p>White (RGB: 255,255,255 HEX: Unknown</p>
<p>Also make sure what you make also looks good in 1 bit Monochrome, or Grayscale/Greyscale as it might be viewed that way</p>
<p>Again, if you want to use even more colors, try 2D or 3D mode</p>
<HR>
<H2>Page size</H2>
<p>Since this page is meant to be viewed on slower browsers, the page size has to be a lot smaller</p>
<p>Make sure your page is within 2048 lines of code, no more than 512 characters per line, and has less than 65536 characters total</p>
<p>If needed, make a second page as a part 2, and link to it</p>
<p>If you want to make your page bigger than 65.536 Kilobytes in size, go to 2D or 3D mode</p>
<HR>
<H2>Allowed characters (English mode)</H2>
<p>This mode is designed to be highly compatible with old and new browsers. For compatibility with early 1990s web browsers, the character set of this mode is limited to ASCII</p>
<p>The allowed characters are:</p>
<p><b>Numbers</b></p>
<p>0123456789</p>
<p><b>Symbols</b></p>
<p>@!$%#^&?+=</p>
<p><b>Punctuation</b></p>
<p>`~(){}[]-_|\/<>.,;:"'</p>
<p><b>Letters</b></p>
<p>aAbBcCdDeEfFgGhHiIjJkKlLmMnNoOpPqQrRsStTuUvVwWxXyYzZ</p>
<p>If you want to use ANSI, UTF-1, UTF-8, UTF-16 and other encodings, try 2D or 3D mode</p>
<H2>Allowed characters (other)</H2>
<p>Unknown</p>
<HR>
<H2>Stylesheets</H2>
<p>Stylesheets are allowed, but limited to the rules of this mode. This makes it so you can only use the 16 colors. Only CSS 1.0 is allowed, for compatibility with older browsers</p>
<p>Elements like gradient/patterned backgrounds, transparency, buttons, and more are not allowed due to this. </p>
<p>Only CSS stylesheets are allowed. Stylesheets in other languages are not allowed. Stylesheets cannot exceed 8192 bytes in size, they can only have up to 100 lines of code, with no more than 50 characters per line</p>
<p>Only up to 3 stylesheets can be used per page. Memory needs to be saved when doing this. It is like developing software in the 1990s, you have to work with limits. If you want to feel modern day development, try 2D, or 3D mode.</p>
<p>CSS stylesheets have the other same rules as the HTML page, ASCII chaaracters only, 16 colors, no images, video, or audio, and also no file can be referenced from within the stylesheet, not even the main HTML page it is being targeted to</p>
<p>In all, if you maxed out your HTML file, and had 3 maxed out stylesheets, that together would take up 24,576 bytes for the stylesheets, 65,536 bytes for the HTML document, and 90,112 bytes in total. It might take a dial-up internet connection longer to load all 90.11 kilobytes, so try to make it lighter</p>
<p>as this mode is designed for virtual machines that use a virtual dial-up connection, which is typically between 22 and 56 kilobits per second (for the main system with a possible 1 gigabit per second internet speed, these pages will load instantly)</p>
<p>Allowed tags include:</p>
<p>#p {} #P {}</p>
<p>#i {} #I {}</p>
<p>#b {} #B {}</p>
<p>#u {} #U {}</p>
<p>#s {} #S {}</p>
<p>#a {} #A {}</p>

<HR>
<H2>Languages</H2>
<p>Languages that are allowed in 1D mode are:</p>
<p>* HTML1</p>
<p>* CSS1</p>
<p>Languages that are not allowed are;</p>
<p>* JavaScript</p>
<p>* HTML2</p>
<p>* HTML3</p>

<p>* XML AJAX</p>
<p>* SQL</p>
<p>* ActionScript</p>
<p>* Perl</p>
<p>* Everything else</p>
<HR>
<H2>Favicon</H2>
<p>This page is designed to run in really old browsers, and also with slow internet connections. The Favicon needs to be adjusted for this.</p>
<p>Favicons have their own set of limits:</p>
<p>* Favicon must be 16x16 pixels, no more, no less</p>
<p>* Favicons can only use the 16 colors available in 1D mode, no more, no less</p>
<p>* Favicons must be between 1 and 4 bit. 4.1 bit and higher is not allowed</p>
<p>There are different rules for 2D mode and 3D mode, if you are unhappy with these rules, try developing in one of those modes</p>
<HR>
<H2>Summary</H2>
<H3>Those are the rules for development in 1D mode</H3>
<p>Not happy with these? Try developing for <a href="../2D/SNU2D_DEVRULES.html">2D mode</a> or <a href="../3D/SNU3D_DEVRULES.html">3D mode</a></p>
